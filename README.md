======

An automated event scheduler.

**TODO**  
assume UI is there

voting: ui just captures the data, kind of done from the back-end POV


cron job weds night
  creates new sports (for now) event
  this should implicitly have time slots for all of the days
  sends out email letting ALL (for now until we incorporate groups) users know about next week's event poll.



cron job tallies votes for each of the current events.
